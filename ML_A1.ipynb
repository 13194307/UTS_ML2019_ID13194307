        "Machine learning is a field that is quickly growing, with its roots spreading to many areas such as social media link prediction, cancer classification and object detection. However one application of machine learning that is of particular interest is generative learning, where models learn to generate data points, specifically images, that are convincing to the human eye. Up until recently, generative models encountered issues such as computational problems that would limit their capabilities. In response to these problems, Goodfellow et al. (2017) [1] proposed in their paper Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This report will discuss the contents of the paper as well as the many implications of this new technique for generative learning."

        "\n",
        "In the paper, the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed as a model that could surpass the prevailing generative models of the time. Generative models attempt to map the actual distribution of the training data in order to create new data points. This is in contrast to discriminative models, which instead try to find a mapping from X to Y for the purpose of prediction. GANs are able to produce data points by learning the data distribution through adversarial learning. This is where a generative model competes with a discriminative model which is trained to guess whether a given sample is from the actual data distribution or was artificially generated by the generative model. The goal of the generative model during training is to reduce the chance of the discriminative model making a correct prediction to be as close to 50% as possible, at which point the synthetic data points are no different to the actual data points. Through the experiments described in the paper where the performance of GANs is compared with other generative models, the authors depict GANs as a promising model for generative learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "GANs address many issues with the prevailing generative models of the time, the most notable issue being the intractability of some probability calculations which would then necessitate the use of less accurate approximations or Markov chains. These problems can greatly hinder the performance of generative models. This is avoided to an extent in GANs as no assumptions about the distribution of the data are made and the model instead learns through competition between the generative model and a discriminative model. If multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are used for both the generative and discriminative model, then the GAN will also have the advantage of being able to use many of the features of MLPs such as backpropagation (for training both the generative and discriminative model) and dropout (for preventing the discriminative model from overfitting). These techniques provide a sizeable performance increase over other generative models."

        "# Innovation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The research on GANs in the paper is extremely innovative for multiple reasons. The first reason is because GANs are able to overcome many of the limitations of other models. Previous generative models such as Deep Directed/Undirected Graphical Models were unable to calculate p(x), the probability distribution for the dataset. These models would need to rely on approximation methods to provide an estimate of p(x), which would hinder the quality of the training provided to the generative model. GANs do not require a representation of p(x) to be trained as the model is trained by a discriminative model instead. Previous generative models also relied on Markov chains to sample from the training data, which was computationally expensive. GANs reduce the computational power required for sampling by utilsing forward propagation, a feature of neural networks where an input provided to the network (in the case of GANs, this input is usually random noise) is transformed into an output by the nodes of the network. These computational advantages make GANs innovative as they expand the realm of possible problems that GANs can solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "The innovativeness of the paper is further supported by the numerous applications of GANs. Generative models are not a niche technique. There are a plethora of ways in which generative models can be applied and consequently any improvement to generative models can have a large impact. As explained previously, GANs are computationally superior to previous generative models and this means that they may prove far more useful in real world problems compared to previous models. However, in many situations certain models will only perform better than other models in specific situations. Whether this is the case for GANs remains to be seen due to the limited number of experiments conducted in the paper. However, the quantitative and qualitative results shown in the paper are promising.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally with GANs being a new technique with extra computational power at its disposal, the research paper does pave the way for further research as there are plenty of new research topics to explore in relation to GANs. This fact, combined with the previous points, contributes to the innovative nature of this paper."

        "# Technical Quality:\n",
        "Overall the paper has a high level of technical quality. The theoretical underpinning of GANs were explained in detail and supported through the use of mathematical equations, proofs and pseudocode, allowing for other fellow researchers to be able to not only gain a thorough understanding of how GANs work but also gives them the opportunity to identity any potential flaws or areas for improvement. While the authors of the paper don't delve too deep into how they set up their experiments, they have included a link to their code on Github. This is extremely useful for validating the reliability and replicability of the results acheived.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there are a few issues that hamper the technical quality of the paper. One of these issues is the limited number of conducted experiments. Only 3 other generative models were used as comparisons and the experiments were limited to only 2 tests. This does, to some extent, bring into question the reliability of the results especially when taking into account that their evaluation method, which uses log-likelihood estimates, can often produce results with high variance. This choice was justified however, due to the absence of a better method for evaluation. The only other source of evaluation provided is a qualitative evaluation, which is not very useful as a qualitative evaluation can be very subjective. However, the authors state that the purpose of the qualitative evaluation is to only demonstrate that GANs are, at the bare minimum, competitive with current state-of-the-art generative models, not to compare the quality of GANs to other models. Despite some flaws, it is clear the authors have put in a lot of effort into the technical quality of the paper."

        "\n",
        "The authors do not discuss the application domain of GANs. However, it can be assumed that the application domain is no different to that of other generative models. Generative models are primarily useful for any problem in which data points, rather than predictions, must be outputted from the model, with the 'data points' representing images. Already GANs have proven to be appropriate when applied to this set of problems. A rather infamous application of GANs are Deep Fakes, where convincing videos of celebrities were created and uploaded online. The amount of media attention generated by Deep Fakes is testiment to the suitability of GANs for generating images or sequences of images. Deep Fakes have not only brought to light the power of GANs, but also highlighted the potential for GANs to be used maliciously.\n",
        "\n",
        "GANs could also potentially be used for more artistic purposes. Since GANs have the ability to generate images that are in some way similar to training images, new pieces of art could be created that are based off a particular artstyle or even a combination of artstyles. In fact, Yanghua Jin et al (2017) [2] were able to demonstrate the ability of GANs to create facial images of anime characters. These images could also be used to provide inspiration to an artist, especially in cases where the generated images may not be of high quality. Another potential application for GANs could be image editing where, as an example, an article of clothing such as a hat or shirt could be transferred from one image to another. While this can be done manually using image manipulation tools such as Photoshop, automating the process would be beneficial.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple directions that future research can take in order to further develop GANs. Future works could conduct research from an optimisation perspective, where the research is focused on achieving performance increases. The authors have suggested that efficiency can be increased through the development of better methods for training the generative and discriminative model as well as better methods for sampling from the distribution. Further research could also develop variants of GANs such as conditional GANs, which add an extra input to the generative model such as a class label. This would allow for the generative model to be able to generate data points from a specific class and would further expand the application domain of GANs. Finally, rather than focusing on producing better performing models, future research could focus on minimising the impact of GANs when utilised for malicious purposes. With the open-source nature of tools for implementing GANs and with techniques for implementing GANs becoming more sophisticated and powerful, it is inevitable that there will be an increase in the misuse of GANs. Therefore, research should also look into ways of either preventing misuse or reducing the impact of any potential misuse. However once GANs become powerful enough, this research may be rendered useless as the theoretical limit for GANs is when they have replicated the distribution of the actual data, at which point artificially generated images are indistinguishable from the actual images.\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper would be extremely interesting to discuss as a class. The paper is one of the more recent papers out of the original list provided and GANs have generated a lot of media attention for its misuse, making GANs an appealing topic to other students. There are plenty of topics to discuss about GANs such as its future applications and its potential for being misused. One thing I found interesting about the paper was the concept of adversarial learning. It is interesting to see how the way GANs learn is similar to how humans learn in many situations such as sports where through competition with other people, we improve. The power of GANs was also interesting as it made me think a lot about the malicious applications of not only GANs but other machine learning models."

The body of the paper contains plenty of depth and does not waste time discussing irrelevant points. Appropriate formatting is used for mathematical equations and pseudocode, and diagrams and graphs are provided in order to present a clearer view of concepts. The language used throughout the paper avoids being overly vebose. The only area that was lacking with regards to the presentation of the paper was the little explanation provided on the setup of the experiments, which leaves the reader confused about how they might replicate the experiment. Although there is a link to the source code, this link is provided in a small font at the footer of the first page which makes it easy to miss and there is no further mention of it throughout the paper. To address this, there would need to be either a more thorough explanation of the experiments or more references to the code (for example, having the link to the source code on every page, rather than at the bottom of the first page only)."
