        "In the paper, the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed as a model that could surpass the prevailing generative models at the time the paper was published. Generative models attempt to map the actual distribution of the training data in order to create new data points. This is in contrast to discriminative models, which instead try to find a mapping from X to Y for the purpose of prediction. Generative Adversarial Networks are able to produce data points by learning the data distribution through adversarial learning. This is where the generative model competes with a discriminative model which is trained to guess whether a given sample is from the actual data distribution or was artificially generated by the generative model. The goal of the generative model during training is to reduce the chance of the discriminative model making a correct prediction to be as close to 50% as possible, at which point the artificial data points are no different to the actual data points.\n",

        "Generative Adversarial Networks address many issues with the prevailing generative models of the time, the most notable issue being the intractability of some probability calculations which would then necessitate the use of less accurate approximations or Markov chains. This problem is avoided in Generative Adversarial Networks as no assumptions about the distribution of the data are made and the model instead learns through competition between the generative model and a discriminative model. If multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are used for both the generative and discriminative model, then the GAN will also have the advantage of being able to use many of the features of MLPs such as backpropagation (for training both the generative and discriminative model) and dropout (for preventing the discriminative model from overfitting)."

The theoretical underpinning of GANs were explained in detail and supported through the use of mathematical equations, proofs and pseudocode, allowing for other fellow researchers to be able to not only gain a thorough understanding of how GANs work but also gives them the opportunity to identity any potential flaws or areas for improvement. While the authors of the paper don't delve too deep into how they set up their experiments, they have included a link to their code on Github. This is extremely useful for validating the reliability and replicability of the results acheived.\n",

        "However, there are a few issues that hamper the technical quality of the paper. One of these issues is the limited number of conducted experiments. Only 3 other generative models were used as comparisons and the experiments were limited to only 2 tests. This does, to some extent, bring into question the reliability of the results especially when taking into account that their evaluation method, which uses log-likelihood estimates, can often produce results with high variance. This choice was justified however, due to the absence of a better method for evaluation. The only other source of evaluation provided is a qualitative evaluation, which is not very useful as a qualitative evaluation can be very subjective. However, the authors state that the purpose of the qualitative evaluation is to only demonstrate that GANs are, at the bare minimum, competitive with current state-of-the-art generative models, not to provide a comparison.
