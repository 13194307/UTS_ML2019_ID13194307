        "Machine learning is a field that is quickly growing, with its roots spreading to many areas such as social media link prediction, cancer classification and object detection. However one application of machine learning that is of particular interest is generative learning, where models learn to generate data points, specifically images, that are convincing to the human eye. Up until recently, generative models encountered issues such as computational problems that would limit their capabilities. In response to these problems, Goodfellow et al. [reference here] proposed in their paper Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This report will discuss the contents of the paper as well as the many implications of this new technique for generative learning."

        "In the paper, the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed as a model that could surpass the prevailing generative models at the time the paper was published. Generative models attempt to map the actual distribution of the training data in order to create new data points. This is in contrast to discriminative models, which instead try to find a mapping from X to Y for the purpose of prediction. GANs are able to produce data points by learning the data distribution through adversarial learning. This is where the generative model competes with a discriminative model which is trained to guess whether a given sample is from the actual data distribution or was artificially generated by the generative model. The goal of the generative model during training is to reduce the chance of the discriminative model making a correct prediction to be as close to 50% as possible, at which point the artificial data points are no different to the actual data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "GANs address many issues with the prevailing generative models of the time, the most notable issue being the intractability of some probability calculations which would then necessitate the use of less accurate approximations or Markov chains. This problem is avoided in GANs as no assumptions about the distribution of the data are made and the model instead learns through competition between the generative model and a discriminative model. If multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are used for both the generative and discriminative model, then the GAN will also have the advantage of being able to use many of the features of MLPs such as backpropagation (for training both the generative and discriminative model) and dropout (for preventing the discriminative model from overfitting)."

        "*   The paper does provide the groundwork for future innovations in the field. With GANs being a new method (at the time of publishing), there is plenty of exploration that can be done with GANs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The research on GANs in the paper is extremely innovative for a multitude of reasons. The first reason is because GANs are able to overcome many of the limitations of other models. Previous generative models such as Deep Directed/Undirected Graphical Models were unable to calculate p(x), the probability distribution for the dataset. These models would need to rely on approximation methods to provide an estimate of p(x), which would hinder the quality of the training provided to the generative model. GANs do not need a representation of p(x) to be trained as the model is trained by a discriminative model instead. Previous generative models also relied on Markov chains to sample from the training data, which was computationally expensive. GANs reduce the computational power required for sampling by utilsing forward propagation, a feature of neural networks where an input passed through the network which, in the case of GANs is usually random noise, will be transformed into an output by the nodes of the network. These computational advantages make GANs innovative as they expand the realm of possible problems that GANs can solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "The innovativeness of the paper is further supported by the numerous applications of GANs. Generative models are not a niche technique. There are a plethora of ways in which generative models can be applied and consequently any improvement to generative models can have a large impact. As explained previously, GANs are computationally superior to previous generative models and this means that they may prove far more useful in real world problems compared to previous models. However, in many situations certain models will only perform better than other models in specific situations. Whether this is the case for GANs remains to be seen due to the limited number of experiments conducted in the paper. However, the quantitative and qualitative results shown in the paper are promising.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally with GANs being a new technique with extra computational power at its disposal, the research paper does pave the way for further research as there are plenty of new research topics to explore. This fact combined with the previous points contribute to the innovative nature of this paper."

        "However, there are a few issues that hamper the technical quality of the paper. One of these issues is the limited number of conducted experiments. Only 3 other generative models were used as comparisons and the experiments were limited to only 2 tests. This does, to some extent, bring into question the reliability of the results especially when taking into account that their evaluation method, which uses log-likelihood estimates, can often produce results with high variance. This choice was justified however, due to the absence of a better method for evaluation. The only other source of evaluation provided is a qualitative evaluation, which is not very useful as a qualitative evaluation can be very subjective. However, the authors state that the purpose of the qualitative evaluation is to only demonstrate that GANs are, at the bare minimum, competitive with current state-of-the-art generative models, not to provide a comparison.

Generative models are primarily useful for any problem in which data points, rather than predictions, must be outputted from the model, with the 'data points' representing images. Already GANs have proven their useful when applied to this set of problems. A rather infamous application of GANs are Deep Fakes, where convincing videos of celebrities were created and uploaded online. The amount of media attention generated by Deep is testiment to the suitability of GANs for generating images or sequences of images. Deep Fakes have not only brought to light the power of GANs, but also highlighted the potential for GANs to be used maliciously.\n",
        "\n",
        "GANs could also potentially be used for more artistic purposes. Since GANs have the ability to generate images that are in some way similar to training images, new pieces of art could be created that are based off a particular artstyle or even a combination of artstyles. In fact, Yanghua Jin et al in their 2017 paper [reference here] were able to demonstrate the ability of GANs to create facial images of anime characters. These images could also be used to provide inspiration to an artist, especially in cases where the generated images may not be of high quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple directions that future research can take in order to further develop GANs. Future works could conduct research from an optimisation perspective, where the research is focused on achieving performance increases. The authors have suggested that efficiency can be increased through the development of better methods for training the generative and discriminative model as well as better methods for sampling from the distribution. Further research could also develop variants of GANs such as conditional GANs, which add an extra input to the generative model such as a class label. This would allow for the generative model to be able to generate data points from a specific class and would further expand the application domain of GANs. Finally, rather than focusing on producing better performing models, future research could focus on minimising the impact of GANs when utilised for malicious purposes. With the open-source nature of tools for implementing GANs and with techniques for implementing GANs becoming more sophisticated and powerful, it is inevitable that there will be an increase in the misuse of GANs. Therefore, research should also look into ways of either preventing misuse or reducing the impact of any potential misuse. However once GANs become powerful enough, this research will most likely be rendered useless as the theoretical limit for GANs is when they have replicated the distribution of the actual data at which point artificially generated images are indistinguishable from the actual images."
